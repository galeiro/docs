The module pattern is a great way to split a larger file into **multiple smaller**, **reusable pieces**. It also promotes **code encapsulation**, since the values within modules are kept private inside the module by default, and cannot be modified. Only the values that are explicitly exported with the `export` keyword are accessible to other files.
