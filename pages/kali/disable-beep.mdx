# Disable Beep Sound

I was looking to find a solution to this problem to
turn off the beep. Editing `inputrc` did not work. So this solution:

``` sh
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/pcspkr-blacklist.conf
```

``` sh filename="/etc/modprobe.d/pcspkr-blacklist.conf"
blacklist pcspkr
```

``` sh
sudo depmod -a
```

``` sh
sudo update-initramfs -u
```

Then reboot your laptop.
